    <p>Beignets are deep-fried, soft, square pastries that are served warm with powdered sugar. This is a traditional New Orleans-style beignet recipe that's easy to make and can't be beat! Grab a café au lait and you're set!</p>
    <h4>Beignets Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>7 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour into a large bowl and stir in evaporated milk, white sugar, eggs, and salt. Add 4 cups flour and beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in shortening. Mix in remaining 3 cups flour. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Roll dough out on floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep pot to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Fry beignets in batches until browned and puffed. (If beignets sink and do not pop up, oil is not hot enough.) Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>Shake confectioners' sugar over hot beignets. Serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
